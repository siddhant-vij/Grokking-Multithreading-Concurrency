## Grokking Multithreading and Concurrency

In the world of computing, concurrency is the execution of multiple instruction sequences at the same time. The core concepts of multithreading, concurrency & parallelism are the essential problem-solving skills that is a "must-have" for every programmer.

```bash
java -cp bin Main x
```

where `x` is an integer as the problem number below:
